# Exercises and Progression - COBOL

This repository is a collection of all the exercises I was given during my COBOL learning experience.\
You will also find some explorations of my own.\
GnuCOBOL was used to compile the programs to machine language.\
The goal is to maintain a documentation of all the concept I used and at least partially understand.
